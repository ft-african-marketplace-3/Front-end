## Field Market


### Pitch 

Field Market empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and
economic opportunities to grow out of poverty.

You will build a platform to enable these business owners to create listing for items they have for
sale.

### MVP

1. A small business owner can login and see relevant prices in various categories to help
them set their own prices.

2. They can also make listing for items they want to sell, which will show up to all users

3. They add a new item by selecting their market location and typing in their item's
name description and price
